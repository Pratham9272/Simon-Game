# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is an interactive web app that challenges users to remember and replicate color and sound sequences. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases my skills in creating engaging, memory-based games. Watch the sequence of lights and sounds, then repeat it by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
